# AndroMalDac
Android Malware Detection Framework Tool
_________________________________________________

In this example, the code scans a directory for APK files (Android application packages) and performs static analysis on each APK file. It calculates the SHA256 hash of each APK and checks if it has a known malware signature. If the signature matches the Android Debug Certificate, it considers the APK as potentially malicious.

To use this code, replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path of the directory containing APK files. Save the code in a Python file, for example, `android_malware_detection.py`, and execute it using Python in Kali Linux:

```
$ python3 android_malware_detection.py
```

The code will scan each APK file in the specified directory and provide output indicating the scan result. You can customize the static analysis and malware detection logic based on your requirements, such as analyzing manifest files, permissions, code structure, or using third-party libraries for more advanced analysis.

Note that this is a simplified example, and effective Android malware detection requires more sophisticated techniques and tools. It is recommended to explore existing Android security frameworks, such as AndroGuard or MobSF, which provide a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for Android malware analysis.
